Some payment methods only appear when specific conditions are met. For cases where you can't get a specific payment method to appear, you can force-enable it with a small change in the Stripe module. If you then go to the checkout page, it displays an error that explains the reason the payment method is unavailable.

## Debugging approach

For example, say that Klarna doesn't appear at checkout. To find out the reason, open `Helper/PaymentMethodTypes.php` and make the following adjustment:

```diff
@@ -15,6 +15,8 @@ class PaymentMethodTypes

     public function getPaymentMethodTypes()
     {
         return ['klarna'];
     }
```

If you now go to the checkout page, an error is displayed explaining why Klarna is unavailable.
